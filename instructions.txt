i'm a swing trader in swings of a month.
I check my stocks daily when the market is closed
i do not intervene in the middle of a trade day

i've attached a json of a stock i'm interested in or invested in
based on technical analysis drawn from technical_data field:

i would like to know if a position i'm in needs adjustment based on technical analysis
i would like to spend my free cash (free_cash field) on interesting opportunities
if i'm in a position:
1. make sure that stop loss covers all quantity of stocks except for small (1-3 stocks) position - for the full amount
2. make sure i don't have stop loss for un-opened positions
for every new buy - add buy price range and stop loss.
for every stop loss - calculate by minimal in-day prices not close price
for every buy - give scode from 1 to 10 about certainty of the buy based on technical analysis (10 being highest confidence)
the buy price range should include the stop price and then the limit price for ideal entry
result should be in a neat table of actions and explanation

double check based on past errors:
perform a deep, manual technical audit (using fresh data from today) for every single position to correct potential errors.
